# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

## Found an Issue

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the GitHub Repository. Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a [new issue](../../../issues)

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

- Search the [repository](../../../pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.

- Make your changes in a new git fork
- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
- Push your fork to GitHub
- In GitHub, create a pull request
- If we suggest changes then
  - Make the required updates.
  - Rebase your fork and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request)

    ```shell

    git rebase main -i
    git push -f

    ```

Thank you for your contribution!
